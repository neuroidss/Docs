#HARDWARE & SOFTWARE

##What do I need to get started?

To get started, all you need is an [OpenBCI Board](http://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage/boards) (Ganglion or Cyton), some electrodes, and a computer! Note that you do not need an Ultracortex. In fact, you can use any standard EEG electrode cap with the OpenBCI Boards.

##Can I use OpenBCI with other hardware & software?

Yes! OpenBCI is designed to be easily interfaced by other hardware and software. They OpenBCI hardware is software agnostic, meaning it works with OpenBCI-specific software, as well as any other 3rd-Party Software that has an OpenBCI driver. Check out the [Tutorials Section](http://docs.openbci.com/Tutorials/01-GettingStarted) to find guides that detail connecting OpenBCI to other tools.

##What is the difference between the [Ganglion](http://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage/products/pre-order-ganglion-board?variant=13461804483), the [Cyton Board](http://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage/products/openbci-32-bit-board-kit?variant=784651699), and the [16-Channel R&D Kit](http://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage/products/openbci-16-channel-r-d-kit?variant=785215991)?

The Cyton Board is an 8 channel biosensing amplifier that can measure ECG, EMG, and EEG. It connects to your computer wirelessly with an included USB Dongle. Data is sampled at 250Hz.
The 16-Channel R&D Kit is the same as the Cyton Board, but it also includes an expansion module to increase the channel count to 16. Data is sampled at 250Hz.
The Ganglion is a 4 channel biosensing amplifier that can measure ECG, EMG, and EEG. It connects to your computer via BLE. Data is sampled at 200Hz.

##How do I choose between 4, 8, or 16 channels for my research?

With additional channels, you have additional spatial resolution. The Ganglion (the 4-channel board) is great for low-cost research and education. The Cyton (8-16 channels) provides additional spatial resolution, enabling more diverse types of research requiring higher channel counts.
