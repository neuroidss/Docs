# OpenBCI Hardware 

Welcome to the OpenBCI Hardware documentation page. Here you will find specifications of the OpenBCI suite of devices.  

The [Cyton](http://docs.openbci.com/Hardware/02-Cyton) page covers the hardware specs of our 8 channel board and Dongle, as well as our expansion Daisy Module. 
The [Cyton Data Format](http://docs.openbci.com/Hardware/03-Cyton_Data_Format) page has all the information about how we package up the raw sensor data and send it wirelessly to the OpenBCI Dongle. There are two tutorials on how to [upload your custom code to the Cyton](http://docs.openbci.com/Hardware/05-Cyton_Board_Programming_Tutorial), and also how to [reprogram the Cyton Radio Modules](http://docs.openbci.com/Hardware/06-Dongle_Programming_Tutorial)


The [Ganglion page](http://docs.openbci.com/Hardware/07-Ganglion) covers the specs of our 4 channel biosensing platform. 
The [Ganglion Data Format](http://docs.openbci.com/Hardware/08-Ganglion_Data_Format) page explains how we compress the raw Ganglion data and send it to a computer or phone or tablet via Bluetooth. The [Ganglion Programming Tutorial](http://docs.openbci.com/Hardware/09-Ganglion_Programming_Tutorial) page will walk you through how to modify the Ganglion firmware, and upload it Over The Air (OTA) using your smartphone!

Enjoy!
